## 🎯 Problem Statement

Let _a + b = c_ be a sum of **coprime positive integers**.  
The ABC Conjecture states:

**For any ε > 0, there exists K<sub>ε</sub> such that:**  
**c < K<sub>ε</sub> · rad(abc)<sup>1+ε</sup>**

Here `rad(n)` is the product of distinct prime divisors of _n_.

## 🧠 Proof Strategy: Collapse Chain

We build the structural chain:

**PH₁(Fₐᵦ𝑐) = 0 ⇒ Ext¹(Fₐᵦ𝑐, ℚₗ) = 0 ⇒ E(t) ≤ Ae<sup>−κt</sup> ⇒ log c ≤ (1 + ε) log rad(abc)**

Each step corresponds to:

- **Topological triviality**: persistent homology collapse  
- **Cohomological vanishing**: Ext-class trivialization  
- **Energy decay**: filtration-based collapse  
- **Logarithmic bound**: implied ABC inequality

## 🔧 Collapse Structure Summary

Collapse logic forms the functorial chain:

PH₁(Fₐᵦ𝑐) = 0  
↓  
Ext¹(Fₐᵦ𝑐, ℚₗ) = 0  
↓  
E(t) ≤ Ae<sup>−κt</sup>  
↓  
log c ≤ (1 + ε) log rad(abc)

Functors:

- 𝔽<sub>PH→Ext</sub>: persistent → cohomological  
- 𝔽<sub>Ext→Energy</sub>: obstruction → decay  
- 𝔽<sub>Energy→ABC</sub>: decay → growth bound

## ✅ Completion Status

This version completes the structural proof of the ABC conjecture under:

- PH₁ collapse (persistent homology trivial)  
- Ext¹ vanishing (derived obstruction removed)  
- Collapse energy decay  
- ZFC + MLTT (type theory) consistency

Thus:

**PH₁ = 0 ⇒ Ext¹ = 0 ⇒ E(t) ≤ Ae<sup>−κt</sup> ⇒ log c ≤ (1 + ε) log rad(abc)**  
→ This implies the ABC Conjecture in formal logic.

## 🧩 Related Theory: AK High-Dimensional Projection (AK-HDPST)

The ABC Collapse Theorem is built upon:

**AK High-Dimensional Projection Structural Theory**  
→ [AK-HDPST GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Kobayashi2501/AK-High-Dimensional-Projection-Structural-Theory)

This theory formalizes:

- Collapse logic with barcode topology  
- ZFC + dependent type systems  
- Ext-class functors and homological trivialization  
- Structural unification of arithmetic conjectures
